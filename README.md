## Marketing Sales Analysis & Prediction Project
## roject Overview
This project analyzes the impact of advertising spending and discount strategies on sales performance. The goal is to understand key business drivers and build a predictive model to support data-driven marketing decisions.

## Business Problem
Companies invest heavily in marketing and promotions, but often lack clear insight into:
How advertising spend influences sales
The effect of discount rates on revenue
Whether future sales can be predicted using marketing data
This project addresses these questions using data analysis and machine learning.

## Objectives
Explore relationships between marketing factors and sales
Clean and prepare data for analysis
